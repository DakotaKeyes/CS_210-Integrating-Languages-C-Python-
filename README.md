Programming Languages

For this project, we were asked to create a program that integrated C++ & Python.  We were instructed to print a list of the items that were purchased that day, the number of each item purchased, and create a visualization of each item sold. I really like the customizations I did to enhance the user interface and the aesthetics of the program.  I was able to change the colors for each different options in the menu.  Depending on which option the user selects, it will display the neccessary requirements in different colors.  I also tried to layout the text so the console looking clean dn tidy. I think I could have done the same requirements in less code.  I am not sure if I overthought some of the requirements and this could have led to longer than neccessary coding. I had trouble integrating the Python functions into the C++ code.  This is the most I struggled with in this assigment.  I can use this intergration of languages for further use in my schooling and career in the future. I used comments and spacing to help increase readibility and adaptability. This is useful in the future if the specifications for the program needs to be changed or updated by a different programmer.  You want write the code so that if someone new had to makes changes they would be able to follow and understand your code easily.
